Instagram. It's the app that all of your friends have.

That's about all the good I can say about it.

I'm here today to gripe about one thing: settings you can only change on the phone app. I think device-locking the ability to add **a link to your profile** is rather silly- especially with a social media service that's owned by a billion dollar company.

Does this mean that I have an Instagram account? Yes.
Does this mean I will ever use or promote it? No.
